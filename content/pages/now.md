## Now

_This page was last updated on {{< current_date >}} and inspired by [Derek Sivers][nownownow]_

Spend the summer in Taiwan. 

We had a very enjoyable time, reconnect with family
and old friends, and visit our favorite restaurants, cafes, sport centers and
massage parlors. I am very grateful to call Taiwan home.

This summer we recorded tons of videos with our new DJI Osmo Action 4, so need
to review and edit them soon.

I spent four weeks on vacation, which is something I hadn't done earlier.
Literally didn't open the laptop for the entire time. Honestly was dramatic to
go back to work, but I think I have never been so present with my kids. I am lucky my
colleagues are some very reliable folks.

I bought lots of books recently. I am trying to mix my reading between novels,
Very Short Introductions, personal development, popular science, and textbooks.

Books that I am currently reading:

* Proof and the Art of Mathematics: read first 5 chapters + exercises
* Nuclear Power: A Very Short Introduction
* Think Faster, Talk Smarter

Since I am reading a book about mathematical proof writing, I am considering
going the extra mile and try to prove a couple of theorems with Lean.

Other than reading, this past few months I have been trying to be more
consistent:

- Gym 2-3 days a week, with focus on unilateral exercises and mobility
- Running targeting an average weekly mileage of 30km, for now maintainance since I have no
  big race coming up soon (Strava helps track my goals)
- Yin Yoga at home with the Down Dog app whenever I don't have time for either running or strength
  training
- Recently made it a personal goal to overcome kyphosis. I have _suffered_ from
  rounded shoulders for years. A couple of years ago I bought an ergonomic chair
  (HÃ…G Capisco), an split mechanical keyboard (ZSA Moonlander), standing desk,
  and while it helps, it's really not enough.
  
Decided to split my journal into several notebooks, the idea of having
collections is starting to not work for me, perhaps having dedicated notebooks
like a commonplace books.

I've been meaning to read the Rust book for a while, for both better maintain
the Rust code we have at work and to evaluate it as a potential contender for
new projects in the future.

I am now debating whether to go to EuroRust or Lambda World in October.
