# `$ whoami`

These pages are by me, Alex Moreno. I was born and raised in Barcelona, Spain,
but I spent several years living abroad, particularly during the 2010s in
Taipei, Taiwan.

A formally trained electrical engineer and a functional programmer by trade, I
inadvertently worked my way up from hardware design to kernel and low-level
programming of embedded systems to building real-time streaming data pipelines
and event-driven applications. So, in a certain way, I climbed the ladder.

I enjoy telling stories and going down rabbit holes. I have always been
fascinated by the interplay between theory and practice in programming and enjoy
exploring that through various lenses, in particular the use of emerging tools
for reasoning about programs---the discipline known as formal methods. More
broadly, I have a long-standing interest in mathematical logic and computer
science.

If you want to reach out to me with ideas, projects, or just want to
say hi, I go by the moniker _moleike_ on social media and online communities.
