# `$ whoami`

These pages are by me, Alex Moreno. I was born and raised in Barcelona, Spain,
but I spent several years living abroad, particularly during the 2010s in
Taipei, Taiwan.

A formally trained electrical engineer and a functional programmer by trade, I
inadvertently worked my way up from hardware design to kernel and low-level
programming of embedded systems to building real-time streaming data pipelines
and event-driven applications. So, in a certain way, I climbed the ladder.

I have always been captivated by the interplay between theory and practice in
programming and its relationship with mathematics. Concretely, I enjoy exploring
tools, trends and theories for reasoning about programs and building dependable
software at scale---the discipline known as formal methods. More broadly but on
the same theme, I have a long-standing interest in logic and its many
applications.

If you want to reach out to me with ideas, projects, or just want to say hi, I
go by [moleike][keybase]---my anglicised Chinese name---on the usual places.
