# `$ whoami`

These pages are by me, Alex Moreno. I was born and raised in Barcelona, Spain.

A formally trained electrical engineer and a functional programmer by trade, I
inadvertently worked my way up from hardware design to kernel and low-level
programming of embedded systems to building real-time streaming data pipelines
and event-driven applications. So, in a certain way, I climbed the ladder.

I believe that software engineering demands the same rigour as the other
engineering disciplines, and especially programming in the large needs formal
approaches grounded in mathematics to manage complexity and eliminate ambiguity.
More broadly but on the same theme, I have a long-standing interest in logic and
its many applications.

Since childhood, one of my most defining traits has been my passion for 'peeking
under the hood' of things, and I remember being mesmerized by what at the time
looked like magic, microchips. By a curious twist of fate I ended up living in
the mecca of semiconductors, Taiwan, but for very unrelated reasons.

If you want to reach out to me with ideas, projects, or just want to say hi, I
go by [moleike][keybase]---my anglicised Chinese name---on the usual places.
