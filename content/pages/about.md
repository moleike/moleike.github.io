# `$ whoami`

These pages are by me, Alex Moreno. I was born and raised in Barcelona, Spain,
but I spent the 2010s living in Taipei, Taiwan.

A formally trained electrical engineer and a functional programmer by trade, I
inadvertently worked my way up from hardware design to kernel and low-level
programming of embedded systems to building real-time streaming data pipelines
and event-driven applications. So, in a certain way, I climbed up the ladder.

I enjoy telling stories and going down rabbit holes. Broadly, I like exploring
the interplay between theory and practice in programming through various lenses
and have a long-standing interest in mathematical logic and computer science.
