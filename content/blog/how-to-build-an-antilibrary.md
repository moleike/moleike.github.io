Last Christmas, I was gifted a nice little book about words that are
untranslatable to other languages, aptly entitled, _Lost in
translation_---yes, the same title as the critically acclaimed 2003
film from Sofia Coppola.

These lexical gaps embody concepts or ideas that while only define in one
language, are often universal. This little book captures more than mere
curiosity; it is like to finally being able to label complicated emotions and
experiences I am sure most people can relate to. For instance, the Yiddish word
_trepverter_ means "a witty comeback you think of only when it is too late to
use"---I personally can vividly remember a few too many times of trepverter
pain.

Or the more romantic Arabic term _ya'aburnee_ (يقبرني) means literally
"You bury me" a declaration of person's hope that they’ll die before another
person because living without them would be unbearable.

The book contains several Japanese terms---not surprised I guess---like the
popular wabi-sabi, _komorebi_, which describes the subtle yet beautiful
phenomenon of sunlight leaking through foliage and trees, and the word which got
me started with this blog post: _tsundoku_.

Tsundoku means piling books you haven't read yet. I happen to be an expert at
tsundoku. I buy books almost every month, and keep track of those that I want to
read (acquired or not) on my goodreads [shelves].

The concept of tsundoku largely overlaps with _antilibrary_, a term coined by
Umberto Eco and used by Nassim Nicholas Taleb in his book The Black Swan:

> The writer Umberto Eco belongs to that small class of scholars who are
> encyclopedic, insightful, and nondull. He is the owner of a large personal
> library (containing thirty thousand books), and separates visitors into two
> categories: those who react with “Wow! Signore, professore dottore Eco, what a
> library you have ! How many of these books have you read?” and the others - a
> very small minority - who get the point that a private library is not an
> ego-boosting appendage but a research tool. Read books are far less valuable
> than unread ones. The library should contain as much of what you don’t know as
> your financial means, mortgage rates and the currently tight real-estate
> market allows you to put there. You will accumulate more knowledge and more
> books as you grow older, and the growing number of unread books on the shelves
> will look at you menancingly. Indeed, the more you know, the larger the rows
> of unread books. Let us call this collection of unread books an antilibrary.
