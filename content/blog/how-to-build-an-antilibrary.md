Last Christmas, I was gifted a nice little book about words that are
untranslatable to other languages, aptly entitled, _Lost in
translation_---yes, the same title as the critically acclaimed 2003
film from Sofia Coppola.

{{< figure src="/images/lost-in-translation-cover.jpg" class="center" alt="centering" width="70%">}}

The book presents a sample of foreign words, with no translation to other
languages. These words constitute lexical gaps---and headaches to
translators. But perhaps more interestingly, these untranslatable words embody
concepts, emotions, or cultural ideas unique to their original language and
culture.
