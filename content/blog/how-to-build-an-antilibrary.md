Last Christmas, I was gifted a nice little book about words that are
untranslatable to other languages, aptly entitled, _Lost in
translation_---yes, the same title as the critically acclaimed 2003
film from Sofia Coppola.

These lexical gaps embody concepts or ideas that while only define in one
language, are often universal. This little book captures more than mere
curiosity; it is like to finally being able to label complicated emotions and
experiences I am sure most people can relate to. For instance, the Yiddish word
_trepverter_ means "a witty comeback you think of only when it is too late to
use"---I personally can vividly remember a few too many times of trepverter
pain.

Or the more romantic Arabic term _ya'aburnee_ (يقبرني) means literally
"You bury me" a declaration of person's hope that they’ll die before another
person because living without them would be unbearable.

The book contains several Japanese terms---not surprised I guess---like the
popular wabi-sabi, _komorebi_, which describes the subtle yet beautiful
phenomenon of sunlight leaking through foliage and trees, and the word which got
me started with this blog post: _tsundoku_.

Tsundoku means piling books you haven't read yet. I happen to be an expert at
tsundoku.
