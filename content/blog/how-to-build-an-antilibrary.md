Last Christmas, I was gifted a nice little book about words that are
untranslatable to other languages, aptly titled, _Lost in translation_---yes,
the same title as the film from Sofia Coppola. Now this is very related to
sociolinguistics, a subject that I find deeply interesting since I embarked on
my Mandarin Chinese learning journey. I got a copy of the Spanish version.

This is an illustrated book, with each word given a two-page spread. These
words, or lexical gaps, embody concepts or ideas that despite termed in only one
language, to my way of thinking and with a few exceptions, are universal. But
really what this little book captures is more than mere curiosity; I find it
rewarding to finally label complicated emotions or experiences I am sure most
people can relate to.

For instance, the Yiddish word _trepverter_ means "a witty
comeback you think of only when it is too late to use"---I personally can
vividly remember a few too many times of trepverter pain.

Or the more romantic Arabic term _ya'aburnee_ (يقبرني) means literally "You bury
me" a declaration of a person's hope that they’ll die before another person
because living without them would be unbearable.

The book has also an entry for the ostrich effect, a cognitive bias where one
ignores potentially negative but useful information, e.g. put off undergoing a
screening test or checking your account balance when you are overspending---like
if ignorance would save you. Turns out the Dutch have a word for it,
_struisvogelpolitiek_. The word comes from the legend that ostriches bury their
heads in the sand to avoid danger.

Now that cold plunges are trending, this word seems relevant: _warmduscher_,
literally German for a "warm showerer", i.e. a wimp.

There are a few Japanense words in here too: _komorebi_, which describes the
subtle yet beautiful phenomenon of sunlight leaking through the trees and foliage,
and the word which got me started with this blog post: _tsundoku_.

Tsundoku means piling up books you haven't read yet. I happen to be an expert at
tsundoku. I buy books almost every month, and keep track of those that I want to
read (acquired or not) on my goodreads [shelves].

The concept of tsundoku largely overlaps with _antilibrary_, a term coined by
Umberto Eco and used by Nassim Nicholas Taleb in his book The Black Swan:

> The writer Umberto Eco belongs to that small class of scholars who are
> encyclopedic, insightful, and nondull. He is the owner of a large personal
> library (containing thirty thousand books), and separates visitors into two
> categories: those who react with “Wow! Signore, professore dottore Eco, what a
> library you have ! How many of these books have you read?” and the others - a
> very small minority - who get the point that a private library is not an
> ego-boosting appendage but a research tool. Read books are far less valuable
> than unread ones. The library should contain as much of what you don’t know as
> your financial means, mortgage rates and the currently tight real-estate
> market allows you to put there. You will accumulate more knowledge and more
> books as you grow older, and the growing number of unread books on the shelves
> will look at you menancingly. Indeed, the more you know, the larger the rows
> of unread books. Let us call this collection of unread books an antilibrary.
