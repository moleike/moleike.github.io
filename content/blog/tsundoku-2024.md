Last Christmas, I was gifted a nice little book about words that are
untranslatable to other languages, aptly entitled, _Lost in
translation_---yes, the same title as the critically acclaimed 2003
film from Sofia Coppola.

{{< figure src="/images/lost-in-translation-cover.jpg" class="center" alt="centering" width="70%">}}

The book is not an encyclopedic collection of foreign words, but rather, a fine
selection with full definitions and matching illustrations.

A reminder of my ignorance.
